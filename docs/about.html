        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Josiah Ruiz and I am junior at Penn State Behrend. My major is Digial
            Media, Arts and Technology with a minor in Marketing. I'm from Edison, New Jersey which
            is about 25 miles from New York City and 60 miles from Philadelphia.</p>

        <h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
        <p>My interests include sports, videogames, music and anime.</p>
        <p>As a New Jersey kid, New York has had a big influence on my life. I'm a big fan of all
            New York sport teams, not including hockey or soccer. My favorite teams are the New York
            Yankees, New York Giants and New York Knicks. These are some of the biggest franchises
            in the world and have been apart of me for as long as I can remember. It has been hard
            the past decade, but I am confident things will turn around.</p>
        <p> I have played videogames for the longest time. My earliest memory dates back to the Wii,
            more specifically Wii Sports and Just Dance. I loved these games growing up and continue
            to enjoy both of these timeless greats. As I have gotten older, my taste has shifted
            towards first person shooting games. The top of my favorites include Rainbow Six Siege,
            Overwatch, Valorant and Fortnite. But I have continued to play sports games. I've
            refraiend from buying NBA 2K and Madden every year as they have decreased in quality
            over the past couple of years.</p>

        <p>My favorite music includes hip-hop, raeggaton, and bachata. My parents always played
            spanish music in the house which has rubbed off on me. Soem of my favorite spanish
            musicians include Daddy Yankee, Plan B and Bad Bunny. I've developed my own interests in
            music outside of my parents as I enjoy listening to diferent rappers. Some of my
            favorite are A Boogie with a Hoodie, Lil Uzi Vert, and 21 Savage. They each have their
            own style and vibe to their songs which is what makes me love listening to their music. </p>
        <p>When I was younger I was never into anime. I thought it was weird because of the Naruto
            kids who ran down the hallways with their arms flailling behind them. A coworker
            introduced me back in 2020, during COVID, so i gave it a shot. I was suggested to watch
            Attack on Titan which is still my favorite to this day. Since then, I have watched
            several anime shows such as Jujitsu Kaisen, Tokyo Ghoul and Jojo's Bizarre
            Adventure.</p>
        <h1>Portfolio Work</h1>
        <p>Over the summer of 2023, I have created several pieces of art in Adobe Photoshop. I
            included some of my favorite works that I have created so far.</p>
