        <h1>Portfolio Work</h1>
        <p>Over the summer of 2023, I have created several pieces of art in Adobe Photoshop. I
            included some of the works that I have created so far.</p>
        <div class="gallery">
            <figure>
                <img src="images/posterpota.png" alt="Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"
                    class="photo" />
                <figcaption>This is a poster I made for Kingdom of the Planet of the
                    Apes.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is one of my worst works in Photoshop. I wanted to create a mock-up pster for
                the upcoming Planet of the Apes movie. I already watched the latest iteration of the
                series with "War for the Planet of the Apes", which released in 2017. I wanted to
                create something more original, but there were no photos or video of Cesar's son,
                Cornelius. He is the assumed main character for the future after his father's
                passing. I wanted to pay homage to Cesar while also looking forward to the new Ape
                Kingdom. </p>

        <div class="gallery">
            <figure>
                <img src="images/editharper.png" alt="Bryce Harper" class="photo" />
                <figcaption>Bryce Harper and Orlando Arcia after Game 3 of the 2023
                    NLDS.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I have made other works in Photoshop and Illustrator, but this one was a first for me.
                I made this image before Game 3 even finished. I took the picture off of ESPN's
                Instagram account and took it to Photoshop. The quote "Atta-Boy Harper", is a quote
                from the other player in the picture Orlando Arcia. He made a funny remark towards a
                baserunning mistake from Bryce Harper that caused his team to lose the game prior.
                In retalliation, Harper hit two home-runs, starring down Arcia both times, en-route
                to a 10-2 Phillies win.</p>

                <figcaption>Texas Rangers advance to the World Series.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This photo is very similar to the last one I made, but I wanted to show this as it is
                my most recent work in Photoshop. I took a similar approach as the last edit by
                taking the picture from ESPN. I used an image from <a href="https://texturelabs.org"></a> to
                be the background. I used a couple different png images off of Google, such as the
                World Series trophy and the state of Texas. I used light images from texturelabs and
                placed them on his eye and on the star patch on his jersey. I'm proud where I have
                gotten to in the past five months and can't wait to see how much more I will
                improve.</p>
